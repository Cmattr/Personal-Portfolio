            <blockquote>
                I was born in Kentucky on October 5th, 1993. I come from a family of engineers working in various fields, so you could say it's the family business.

                My interest in technology was sparked by my father, who is a software engineer. As a child, I would spend time with my father and uncle, 
                who piqued my curiosity by showing me the newest websites and applications they were developing. While attending college as a biology major, I minored in computer science.
                This rekindled my fascination with creating and developing applications. After college I spent time trying to figure out what to do with my life.
                I spent a few years tyring out different carrers. Everything from Resturaunt work to Automotive, I even spent some time as an E.M.T. during the covid pandemic working
                for Jeffersontown Fire Department. During this time my brother began in a coding bootcamp of his own. It was his persuasion and experience that lead me to pursue a career as a software engineer.
                
                I am currently enrolled in the Coding Temple software engineering course, and I am excited to continue my education and explore new career opportunities.
